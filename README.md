# Algo Bricks

Build some algorithm bricks and put down that LEGO kid.

## Available Demos
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm is available in ```<Dijkstra/>``` located in the visual-demos/src/ directory and rendered in ```<App/>```. (These files are respectively named as Dijkstra.tsx and App.tsx)
2. Cryptographic Distributed Algorithm is available in the proofs-and-theory/rust/binder directory in ```crypto.rs```. The procedure stems from concepts expressed in this paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1767.pdf
3. Atomically safe time to pursue convergence proof in quantum_dist
* Based off of the findings here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09431 which discusses distributed quantum algorithms to safely examine properties of reads with 2/3 consistency with additive error E.
