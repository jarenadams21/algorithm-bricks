# Rust Algos
1. To run any example, you can typically look in the binder, find an algorithm you'd like to run, and replace ```src/main.rs``` contents with the contents of the file you found in binder. The current example uses ```binder/crypto.rs```
2. You can then run ```cargo run``` as usual in this directory, ensuring you also updated the Cargo.toml to match the dependencies of the incoming file contents.
3. Make sure to pull in associated configs or support files into the root rust directory that should be included in the directory where you found the algorithm originally (e.g., access_structure.json for crypto.rs)
